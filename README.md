In this Spring Boot project I enabled the loading of a csv file into Java model objects. 
 
These model objects were created and edited through model binding, and validated through @Valid class annotations. 

Once validated, these model objects are passed into the view. 

There is a list function to view all the objects, and also a search function to find a specific object.

Spring Thymeleaf templating markup was used to render dynamic content.

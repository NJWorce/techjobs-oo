Java / Spring Boot assignment

For this assignment the work I completed was as follows:
Reading and comprehending code written by others.
Working with model classes via a data access layer (in this case, JobData) retrieving data from a csv file.
Using model binding and validation with model class annotations. 
Utilizing Spring's Thymeleaf templating markup (similar to xml) to effectively render dynamic content.
